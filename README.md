IN THIS PROGRAM ,WE ARE TAKING N NUMBERS FROM USER AND SORTING IT USING BUBBLE SORT IN ASCENDIND ORDER.
SORTING IS DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT SMALLEST NUMBER COMES FIRST.
ALSO SWITCH CASE IS USED SO THAT IF WE WANT TO CALL SORTING FUNCTION REPEATEDLY,WE WILL USE RECURSIVE FUNCTION ELSE SIMPLE SORTING WOULD BE DONE.
I HAVE USED SOFTWARE CODEBLOCKS 16.01 BUT IT CAN BE COMPILED USING OTHER SOFTWARE ALSO.
